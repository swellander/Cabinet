        %p The ability to manage a business depends on great organizational skills. To be able to manage other people, you must know how to set priorities and allocate them according to each individualâ€™s skills and abilities. A well organized manager can perform this easily while exuding confidence and control in the organization, creating a productive environment for all workers. The organizational skills of a manager are also geared toward specific tasks, such as setting project deadlines and conducting performance evaluations, all of which contributes to a more efficient work system.
